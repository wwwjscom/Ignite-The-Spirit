    		<div class="about_content">
    		    <p>Every Chicago Fire Department vehicle proudly displays the phrase, "We're there when you need us."  Ignite the Spirit was created for Chicago firefighters and their families in times of need.  This is our chance to give back to those who put their lives at risk on a daily basis and for giving something back to them for doing so much for the communities and neighborhoods in which we live.  Ignite the Spirit lets our firefighters know that we’ll be there when THEY need US.<br /><br /> 
  
To date, Ignite the Spirit has helped 59 families in their time of need totaling over $150,000.  Not only does Ignite the Spirit help families financially, we have collected an upwards of 4,000 toys and children’s gifts during each Christmas season!  New toy donations are collected and given to local hospitals and other deserving charities.  This is just another way of us leaving no one behind; especially our kids, during the season of giving.  In years past, not only have we accomplished putting smiles on the faces of kids in and around Chicago during Christmas, but we have also taken gifts to the areas devastated by Hurricanes Rita and Katrina in 2005.  In addition to toy drives, Ignite the Spirit holds 8-10 fundraising events throughout the year including a firefighter calendar, softball game, numerous pancake breakfasts and our largest fundraiser, the golf outing.<br /><br /> 

Our fundraisers help to spread the word about Ignite the Spirit. Our advertising is all word of mouth.  Friends and family like you are what makes us great!  Without the interest that has been circulated about Ignite the Spirit, an impact on the lives of others could not have been made.  <br /><br /> 

Thank you for visiting our site and supporting Ignite the Spirit! </p>
