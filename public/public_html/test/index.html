            <p>The Ignite the Spirit Fund was created to raise funds for Chicago firefighters and their families in times of need.
              By supporting the Ignite the Spirit Fund, you’ll be helping the firefighters take care of their own. It’s your chance 
              to give something back to them for doing so much for the communities in which we live. <a href="about.html">[Read more]</a></p>

            <p> Chicago Firefighter/Paramedic James McGann says he gets the same rush from jumping out of an airplane that he does 
              running into a burning building to try to save someone. &ldquo;There has always been an interest in this field for me 
              because while it looks very exciting you can still help people in their time of need.&rdquo; <a href="calendar.html">[Read More]</a></p>
